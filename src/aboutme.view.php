                                My name is Samir Mohamed Ahmed Mahmoud Khalil. I know, it’s long. I’m from
                                Sudan, North Africa, but I grew up in Saudi
                                Arabia for most of my life. I was lucky enough to go to a private school, so I
                                speak English and Arabic. However, I
                                consider English my first language.
                            </p>

                                I enrolled in the University of Technology Bahrain in 2019 as a Business
                                Administration Major. I lacked the confidence
                                in myself to do computer science, despite my obsession with technology since a
                                young age.

                                About a year and a half in, I switched majors to Computer Information Systems to
                                bridge a middle ground between what I
                                actually want to do and to avoid losing too many credits. I plan on becoming a
                                web developer, so I enrolled in a Udemy
                                course. I have been slowly working through it for the past few months and plan
                                on consistently growing my experience in
                                this field.
